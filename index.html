    <li>Root your phone
    <li>Install Recovery, Busybox, custom kernels

    <li>Optimize (install of JIT v2) (Disabled in 0.4, will readd it as a plugin for 2.1 phones only)
    <li>Customize (installs apps found in the custom/apps folder of the flashtool)

<p>On 2011 line devices, you have to be in MSC mode instead of MTP mode. Here is how to switch to MSC mode :

<p>Plugins will appear in the plugin menu if and only if all plugin requirements are met.
<br>Here are requirements for BL Unlock plugin :
<li>kernelversions=2.6.29,2.6.29-00054-g5f01537
<li>androidversions=2.1,2.2,2.3
<li>needroot=true
<li>compatibledevices=X10,E10,E15,U20
<p> If at least one of these criteria is not met, plugin will not be added to the Plugins menu

<p>Well, the flash button will ALWAYS be available. If your device is not recognized, Flashing will be the only feature available.
<br>It means you can flash FTF bundles made for your device and upgrade / downgrade your device.

  translation will be able to.
- Reworked menus to be more clear (too much things into Tools menu)
- Update java to jre7u10 for both windows and linux
- Device editor can now deal with loaders for setool unlocked / modded phones (unlocked loader)
- When flashing, better loader detection that will prevent flashing of modded phones to fail with a verification header
  failure. For such phones, unlocked loader must be included in the device settings. One is included for R800 devices
  and is probably the same for all 2011 devices (tested only with R800 device ... thanks nickholtus and alejandrissimo)
- No more application hang when flashing with debug mode on. Better debug output (more helpfull)
- Reworked a little sin parser to better detect sin header size
- Flashing session is now closer to what SEUS or PCCompanion do.

  Everything should be fine now.

* 0.9.9

  Libusbx is now used instead of libusb (http://www.libusbx.org)

- Updated SuperSU to 0.97
- updated adb and fastboot for mac for adb restore root trick.

- Added Yaffs extractor.
- Improved rooting devices by giving the choice of the SU package to install (Superuser or SuperSU)

  ie for LT26 device : [Flashtool]/custom/clean/L26 and [Flashtool]/custom/apps_saved/L26
- Added the Emulator root exploit used on LT15/LT18 ICS 4.0.3 to root it
- When trying to force root, FT checks if device is already rooted and warn about it
- When trying to force root, better error handling with explicit message when exploit does not work
